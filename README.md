# automated-glacier-terminus

Created and managed by Jukes Liu (jukesliu@u.boisestate.edu).

This repository contains code to automatically delineate glacier terminus positions in Landsat-8 imagery using the 2D Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM) segmentation method for Greenland's peripheral glaciers. 

Certain sections of code require the installation of GDAL command line functionality. The 2D WTMM analysis requires installation of Xsmurf software. Please contact andre.khalil@maine.edu or jukesliu@u.boisestate.edu for ways to obtain Xsmurf.

The Jupyter notebooks should be run in order 1, 2, and then 3. Change path names to reflect the file structure on your computer. 

This repository is updated regularly, so stay tuned for user-friendly adjustments to the code!
